# DST-Framework
A testing framework for distributed systems

##ATTENTION
The framework in its current state has quite a few bugs, given the fact that it was developed within in 1 month as part of a bachelor thesis. That's why I highly recommend not using this framwork in productive environments. Use it at your own risk and do not hold me responsible if anything breaks. See also license below.
